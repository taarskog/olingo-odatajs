# olingo-odatajs
This is a 'Fork' of the [Olingo OData Client for JavaScript](https://olingo.apache.org/doc/javascript/) Library to make it available on [Bower](http://bower.io/).

The Olingo OData Client for JavaScript (odatajs) is a library written in JavaScript that enables browser based frontend applications to easily use the [OData protocol](http://www.odata.org/) for communication with application servers.

This library supports the OData v4 protocol.
